-each mob has an animation queue
-animations in the queue can have a timer or be recursive
-multiple layers can be shown at once
-each mob has their own "library" of animations

So for the grapple animation:
-target is set to blank recurring
-attacker has top and bottom layers fetched
-target has struggling animation fetched
-attacker has both added to queue in layer, and 'busy' timer set

Animations need: start, end, xOffset, yOffset

They need to be associated with a sprite so know when to clear em


possibilities:
-player prompts move with key
-player prompts move with button
-path is pre-set
-player switches active character

We'll add a "faction controller" as an intermediate between field and mob.  In peaceful mode, moves all mobs as soon as animation finishes.  In combat mode, moves all and lets 

Maybe it doesn't need to be a whole class, just an extension to field.  So if the faction is player, rather than immediately prompting a new move, it simply waits for the player to move it if in peaceful.  If in combat, it merely restores all move points.


hm, if I know the x,y coords on a tile, I can surely easily fit the sprite automatically, if it is sized correctly... x is midpoint minus half sprite, y is midpoint - full sprite

So, we trim them and scale them to 50%
